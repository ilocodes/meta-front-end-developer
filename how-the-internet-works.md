# How the Internet Works?
- You open your favorite app on your device and you're instantly connected to the world. This is all made possible because two devices connect and communicate via a wired or wireless connection, forming something called a **network.** 
- But this becomes very complicated very quickly, as each device needs to connect to every other device to communicate effectively. This problem is solved by something called a **network switch** that connects multiple devices and allows them to communicate with each other.
- The network switch can connect to other network switches, and now two networks can connect. These network switches then connect to more network switches until you have something called an **interconnected network.** This interconnected network has another name that you might be familiar with. It's called the **Internet.**
- When we use websites or video streaming services on the Internet, these are provided by computers called **servers.** Our devices are called **clients**. This is known as the **client-server model.**
- Internet connects the entire world. Have you ever had a video call with someone on another continent? That video data travel through large undersea cables connecting the world's networks. These cables can transfer huge volumes of data per second.
