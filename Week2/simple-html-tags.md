# Simple HTML tags

## Heading
Headings allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.

```
<body>
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
</body>
```
## Paragraphs
Paragraphs contain text content.

```
<p>
   This paragraph
   contains a lot of lines
   but they are ignored.
</p>
```
Note that putting content on a new line is ignored by the web browser.

## Line Breaks
As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the <br> tag. The <br> tag does not need a closing tag.

```
<p>
   This paragraph<br>
   contains a lot of lines<br>
   and they are displayed.
</p>
```
## Strong
Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.

```
<p>
   No matter how much the dog barks: <strong>don't feed him chocolate</strong>.
</p>
```

## Bold
Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.

```
<p>
   The primary colors are <b>red</b>, <b>yellow</b> and <b>blue</b>.
</p>
```
Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important. Consider the following example:

```
<p>
   The three core technologies of the Internet are <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b>.
</p>
```

## Emphasis
Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.

```
<p>
   Wake up <em>now</em>!
</p>
```

## Italics
Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.

```
<p>
   The term <i>HTML</i> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
</p>
```
