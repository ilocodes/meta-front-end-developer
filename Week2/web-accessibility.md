# Web Accesibility

As a web developer, it's important to make the internet accessible to everyone, similar to how architects design buildings with ramps and rails for accessibility. Building websites with accessibility in mind is crucial.

Web accessibility, promoted by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) since 1997, aims to make websites usable for people with disabilities. This includes visual, audio, cognitive, neurological, physical, and speech disabilities.

The WAI has developed standards and resources for accessibility, which are considered international standards. In 2016, the EU passed the Web Accessibility Directive, requiring public sector websites and apps to be accessible.

People with disabilities often use assistive technologies like screen readers, speech recognition software, and subtitles. Improving accessibility involves considering it from the start of a project and using proper HTML structure and elements.

Best practices include structuring HTML correctly and avoiding unnecessary line breaks. The WAI's Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification provides techniques for making complex web apps accessible.

Understanding assistive technologies and using correct HTML structures are essential for improving web accessibility.
