# Web Accesibility
As a web developer, you should ensure that everyone can access and enjoy the internet, similar to how an architect designs a building with ramps and rails for accessibility. Building a website to improve accessibility is crucial.

When the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) was launched in 1997, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, stated: 

> "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."

Web accessibility aims to allow people with disabilities to understand, navigate, and interact with websites. It includes all disabilities that affect interaction with websites, such as:

- Visual disabilities
- Audio disabilities
- Cognitive and neurological disabilities
- Physical and speech disabilities

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative developed specifications and supporting resources for accessibility, which are considered international standards. In 2016, the European Union approved the Web Accessibility Directive, requiring public sector websites and mobile applications to be accessible to those with disabilities.

### Examples of Accessibility Provisions

People with disabilities often use assistive technologies:

- **Screen Reader Software:** Reads website content and device activities. Used by blind or vision-impaired users, and those with reading or learning difficulties.
- **Speech Recognition Software:** Converts spoken words into commands or text input. Useful for individuals who cannot use a mouse or keyboard due to physical or neurological disabilities.
- **Subtitles and Video Scripts:** Assist individuals with audio and visual disabilities.

### Improving Accessibility

Consider accessibility from the beginning of a project. Reworking a project later to be accessible is more difficult. Using the correct HTML structure and appropriate elements as a foundation greatly improves accessibility.

#### Best Practices

- Properly structure HTML and use appropriate tags (e.g., paragraph or heading tags).
- Avoid using multiple line breaks to add space.

### Advanced Accessibility Techniques

Complex user interfaces require more than correct HTML for accessibility. The WAI's Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification outlines techniques to improve accessibility for complex web apps.

### Summary

Understanding assistive technologies and using correct HTML structures and elements are key to improving web accessibility.
