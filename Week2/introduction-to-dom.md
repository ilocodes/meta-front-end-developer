# Introduction to DOM 

An HTML document alone allows users to scroll and view content but not to interact with it dynamically. For interactions like logging in, liking posts, or receiving notifications, JavaScript is necessary. This is achieved through the Document Object Model (DOM), a tree-like representation of the HTML document. The DOM allows JavaScript to query and update the document's structure and content.

When a browser loads an HTML page, it constructs a DOM, where each HTML element is an object in the tree. For instance, the root object is `<html>`, containing `<head>` and `<body>` objects, which in turn contain other objects representing elements like `<title>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`, and so on.

JavaScript can access and modify these objects to create dynamic and interactive web pages. For example, JavaScript can update a clock on a website, enable or disable buttons, add error messages, remove items from a to-do list, or animate elements. JavaScript libraries and frameworks, like React, rely on the DOM to build modern web applications. The text concludes by encouraging users to consider how the DOM facilitates the interactivity of their favorite social media sites.
