# What is Hyper Text Markup Language?

When builders start constructing a building, they begin by assembling the frame, which serves as the foundation guiding the rest of the construction. Similarly, an HTML document is like the frame of a building, providing the basic structure with components such as tags and elements.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist, pondered about sharing information online, leading to the development of HTML. The first web page was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, along with the first web browser and web server.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, where "Hypertext" refers to text containing links to other text, and "Markup" refers to tags and elements used within a document.

HTML files have a ".html" suffix and consist of elements and tags. Elements are enclosed in angle brackets, with most having a paired closing tag. For example, a paragraph element is represented by `<p>` for opening and `</p>` for closing.

Elements can contain other elements, and some are self-closing, like the line break tag `<br>`. The HTML specification, maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), defines the rules for elements and tags. The current version is HTML 5.
