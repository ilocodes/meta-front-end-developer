# Frameworks and Libraries
* Frameworks and libraries are pre-existing solutions that developers use to speed up development and solve common problems.
* Libraries are reusable pieces of code that provide specific functionality, such as validating email addresses.
* Frameworks provide a structure for developers to build upon, handling common functionality like receiving HTTP requests.
* Most frameworks use libraries, and developers can also use additional libraries in their applications.
* Frameworks are considered more opinionated, providing a structure and best practices, while libraries offer more freedom.
* Both frameworks and libraries allow developers to reuse existing functions, resulting in faster development and fewer errors.
