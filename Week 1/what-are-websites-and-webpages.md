# What are websites and webpages?

Webpages are individual documents that show content like images, text, and videos in a web browser. Websites, on the other hand, are collections of webpages linked together. When you visit a website's homepage, you'll find links to different articles. Clicking on these links takes you to new webpages. While webpages on the same site usually have similar addresses in your browser, they can also link to other websites.

Webpages are basic text documents that can be edited with any text editor, but developers typically use more advanced tools. Three key technologies are used to create webpages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures content, CSS styles the content, and JavaScript adds interactivity.

HTML uses markup tags to describe content, like headings and paragraphs. CSS adds visual enhancements such as colors and layouts, while JavaScript provides tools for interactivity and data processing. Without JavaScript, websites would be less dynamic and interactive. When you visit a webpage, your browser processes the code to create the visual displayâ€”a process called page rendering.
