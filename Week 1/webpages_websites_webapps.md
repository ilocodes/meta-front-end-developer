# Webpages, Websites and Web Apps

* A web page is a single page that consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays content like images, text, videos, etc., in a web browser.

* A website is a collection of web pages that are linked together under one domain name. It can have multiple pages that link to each other, and they all exist under the same domain name.

* A web application is similar to a website but with a higher level of interactivity and dynamic content. It responds to user input and interaction, like ordering food online.

* The key difference between a website and a web application is the level of interactivity and dynamic content. Websites are more informative, while web applications are more interactive.
