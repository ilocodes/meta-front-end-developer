# What is an IDE?
* An IDE is software for building applications and is like a text editor for writing code.
* IDEs have features like syntax highlighting, which helps developers differentiate keywords from other texts by using different colors.
* Error highlighting is another feature that helps identify mistakes in the code.
* Autocomplete suggests words as you type, making coding faster and more efficient.
* Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of the code without changing its functionality, and IDEs can assist with this by automatically updating the code across all files.
* IDEs also offer other features for bug investigation and collaboration with other developers.
* Overall, IDEs are an essential tool in a developer's toolbox, helping them write code more effectively and efficiently.
