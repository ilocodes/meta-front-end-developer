# How the Internet Works?
- When you open your favorite app on your device, you're instantly connected to the world. This happens because two devices communicate via a wired or wireless connection, forming a **network**.
- Connecting many devices can become complicated. Each device needs to communicate with every other device. A **network switch** solves this problem by connecting multiple devices and allowing them to communicate.
- Network switches can connect to other network switches, creating a larger network. This forms an **interconnected network**, also known as the **Internet**.
- Websites and video streaming services on the Internet are provided by computers called **servers**. Our devices are called **clients**. This setup is known as the **client-server model**.
- The Internet connects the entire world. For example, during a video call with someone on another continent, the video data travels through large undersea cables. These cables can transfer huge volumes of data per second.
