# What is a web browser and how does it work?

A web browser, or simply a browser, is a software application used to navigate the World Wide Web. It operates by sending a request to a web server and receiving a response containing the content to be displayed on your device's screen.

When you open the browser on your device, you use the address bar to enter the website address you wish to visit. This address is known as the Uniform Resource Locator, or URL. The URL includes the protocol (HTTP), the domain name (usually the website name), and the file path (the specific page to be displayed). When you make a request using this URL, the browser and server communicate using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The browser displays the content on your device once it receives it. This process is part of the request-response cycle.

For example, when you open a web browser (a software application) and type the name of your favorite search engine (which includes a domain name), you press Enter. The browser sends a request over the network to a web server, a specialized computer that handles data requests. The web server responds by sending a webpage back to the browser. Once the browser receives the response, it displays the search engine webpage.

A webpage is a coded document rendered by the browser and presented visually to you, the end-user. With the search engine webpage loaded, you can interact with it to search for information. For instance, you might type "restaurants near me" into the search bar and press the search button. The browser sends another request to the search engine web server, this time including instructions to search for "restaurants near me." The web server processes this request by searching a connected database for relevant data. It then sends this data back to the browser. The browser renders the full response as a visible webpage, displaying links to restaurants, a map of nearby locations, and related information such as reviews, lists, and reservation options. This entire process, facilitated by computers communicating, enables you to find the information you need.
