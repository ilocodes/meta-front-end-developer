# Introduction to Internet Protocols

- IP addresses function like addresses in a postal system, allowing packets of information to be delivered.
- There are two versions of the Internet Protocol: version four (IPv4) and version six (IPv6).
- In IPv4, an IP address contains four octets separated by periods (e.g., 192.0.2.235). In IPv6, an IP address contains eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 4527:0a00:1567:0200:ff00:0042:8329).
- Data is sent across a network as a series of IP packets, which contain a header (with destination and source IP addresses) and a payload (the data).
- To ensure data integrity, additional protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are used. TCP ensures data arrives correctly and in order, while UDP is used for data that can tolerate some loss.
- The internet uses internet protocols, similar to a postal system, to ensure data arrives correctly and is not lost or corrupted.
