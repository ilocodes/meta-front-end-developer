# What is a web server and how does it work?

A server is a computer that operates applications and services, such as websites and instant messaging. It's termed a server because it provides services to another computer and its user, known as the client. Servers are typically housed in a **data center** alongside hundreds or thousands of other servers, all running different internet-connected services.

Data centers have numerous systems to ensure that servers receive continuous power, maintain an uninterrupted internet connection, and stay cool 24/7.

Did you know data centers are globally located? Many websites utilize these centers to enable quick content access from the nearest data center. Servers in data centers are built based on their service purpose.

For instance, a server dedicated to storing images may have extensive hard drive space, while a server performing complex calculations might require a fast processor and substantial memory. This is referred to as server hardware, the physical components of a server.

Once server hardware is installed in the data center, software can run on it. Software is the code operating on the hardware. To remember this, think of **hardware as the physical, touchable components that are difficult to change since you must replace them physically. Software is easier to change, as you only need to update the code running on the server.**

A web server has multiple functions, including website storage and administration, data storage, security, and email management. A primary function is handling **web requests.** When you open a browser and type a website's name, the web server's job is to deliver that website's content to you, a process known as the request-response cycle.

Web servers are also designed to handle thousands of client requests per second.
