# Web Hosting

Developers use web hosting to launch websites on the Internet. Web hosting is a service where you place your website and files on a hosting company's web server, essentially renting space for stable and secure storage.

You don't need to be a company to use web hosting; individuals can rent space too. There are different hosting options available:

- **Shared hosting**: The cheapest option where you share a server with many other websites. This can lead to slower performance but is suitable for small websites or for developers practicing deployment.

- **Virtual private server (VPS)**: A virtual server with dedicated CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources. While it runs on a hardware server with other VPS instances, the fixed resources per instance ensure your website's performance isn't impacted by others. It's more expensive than shared hosting.

- **Dedicated hosting**: A dedicated hardware server exclusively for your use, offering all CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources. This option is more expensive than VPS hosting.

- **Cloud hosting**: This has gained popularity in recent years. Your website runs in a Cloud environment spanning multiple physical and virtual servers. If one server fails, your site switches to another, keeping it online. Cloud hosting allows for flexible resource usage without hardware limitations, but costs are based on actual resource use, such as bandwidth consumption.
